Problem Identification Assignments

A company works with numbers of employees, all the works are dependents on the employees. Even if one of the employee resign the job immediately the assigned work will be not finished at the time, so delivery of the project to the client will be delayed. Company 	planned to make solution for this, they want to know which employees may resign next. If they know previously, they can arrange alternative to avoid such problem. As an AI Engineer you must give solution to this. 

A)	How will you achieve this in AI?
                     First, we need to understand the problem. Identify the domain like ML, DL, NLP, TSA. Make the requirements clear and specifying data types. Decide if supervised learning, unsupervised learning, or semi-supervised learning. And finally give call to action


B)	Find out the 3- stage of the problem identification
1	Stage – Machine Learning
2	Stage - Semi Supervised Learning
3	Stage – Regression 


C)	Name the Project
               Employee Resignation Prediction


D)	Create the dummy dataset
Input:
•	Name
•	Role
•	No. of years working under this company 
•	Salary
•	Promotions
•	Working Hours
•	Job Satisfactions 
•	Tenure
       
Output:
•	Resignation / Probability (percentage)
